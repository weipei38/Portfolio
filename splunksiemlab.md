## 🛠️ Day 1: Manual Splunk & UF Setup

**Objective:** Establish baseline Splunk architecture with Universal Forwarder (UF) for ingesting logs from lab machines.

**Reference:** [Manual Splunk and UF Setup Guide](https://www.notion.so/Manual-Splunk-and-UF-Set-up-255829fa6c4d80409910edf6bc1611d9)

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu VM
- Configured Splunk Web UI access and admin credentials
- Deployed Universal Forwarder on Kali machine
- Verified forwarder connectivity via `splunk list forward-server`
- Enabled basic input stanzas for syslog and Suricata logs

### 🔍 Validation Steps
- Confirmed data ingestion via Splunk Search (`index=*`)
- Checked UF logs for successful handshakes
- Ensured Suricata alerts were visible in Splunk

### 🧠 Observations
- Manual UF setup reinforces understanding of deployment topology
- Initial ingestion pipeline is functional—ready for dashboarding

## 🔐 Day 2: Investigating RDP Brute Force Attacks

**Objective:** Detect and analyze Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attempts on Windows endpoints using Splunk.

**Reference:** [Manual: Investigating RDP Brute Force Attacks on Windows](https://www.notion.so/Manual-Investigating-RDP-Brute-Force-Attacks-on-Windows-250829fa6c4d80d6adccd8599ea0b066)

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Identified relevant Windows EventCodes (e.g., 4625 for failed logins)
- Built Splunk search queries to isolate repeated login failures
- Applied time filters and aggregation to detect brute force patterns
- Mapped attacker IPs and usernames from raw event data

### 📊 Dashboard Progress
- Created panels for:
  - Failed login attempts over time
  - Top source IPs triggering 4625 events
  - Username frequency distribution
- Applied shared tokens for dynamic filtering

### 🧠 Observations
- Brute force detection hinges on correlating frequency and timing
- Splunk’s timechart and stats functions are ideal for pattern surfacing
- Next step: enrich with Suricata alerts for lateral movement detection

### 🧾 Artifact Highlight: Suspicious File Creation

The following Sysmon event shows `powershell.exe` creating a file named `micar.com.txt`—a strong indicator of post-exploitation activity:

- **Event Time:** 08/19/2025 12:02:56 AM  
- **Process:** `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`  
- **Target File:** `C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\micar.com.txt`  
- **User:** `WIN-VJ19019120\Administrator`  
- **Event Source:** `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`  
- **Event Type:** `TaskCategory=File created (rule: FileCreate)`

This event can be correlated with earlier 4625 login failures to build a timeline of compromise.
